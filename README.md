# EG-Fwd-On-Demand-Traffic-Control

Project Introduction


Traffic lights are signaling devices positioned at road intersections, pedestrian crossings, and other locations to control the flow of traffic.



Traffic lights normally consist of three signals, transmitting meaning to drivers and riders through colors and symbols including arrows and bicycles.

The regular traffic light colors are red, yellow, and green arranged vertically or horizontally in that order.

Although this is internationally standardized, variations exist on national and local scales as to traffic light sequences and laws.



You are required to implement a traffic lights system with an on-demand crosswalk button.

Crosswalk buttons let the signal operations know that someone is planning to cross the street, so the light adjusts, giving the pedestrian enough time to get across.

User story 1

As a pedestrian when I will make a short press on the crosswalk button while the cars green light is on and pedestrian red light is off, I will wait for the yellow lights to blink for five seconds then the cars red light is on and pededstrian green light is on for five seconds, so that I can cross the street

User story 2

As a pedestrian when I will make a short press on the crosswalk button while the cars yellow light is blinking and pedestrian red light is on, I will wait for all yellow lights to blink for five seconds then the cars red light is on and pededstrian green light is on for five seconds, so that I can cross the street

User story 3

As a pedestrian when I will make a short press on the crosswalk button while the cars red light is on and pedestrian green light is on, I expect nothing to be done

User story 4

As a pedestrian when I made a long press on the crosswalk button, I expect nothing to be done.

User story 5

As a pedestrian when I made a double press on the crosswalk button, I expect that the first press will do the action and nothing to be done after the second press.
